        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Practically everyone has lived through one of those crazy 
            roommate situations — the kind that provides fodder for 
            endless stories over cocktails. These stories are amusing 
            in retrospect, but never fun when they are actually happening. 
            (One of mine actually involved a missing python snake in our 
            apartment.)</p>
        <p>But every now and then, something decent comes from all the 
            insanity. One of my favorite memories from an otherwise mismatched 
            roommate situation is learning how to make candy cane cookies.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter or margarine</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
