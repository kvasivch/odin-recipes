        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Borscht is a sour soup that is traditionally made with 
            meat stock and boiled vegetables. The Ukrainian version, 
            which features beets, is perhaps the most well known type 
            — but varieties of borscht can be found throughout Central 
            and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. </p>
