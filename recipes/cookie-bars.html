        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These festive Christmas cookie bars are like a holiday 
            chocolate chip cookie in bar form. They come together 
            quickly—using just one bowl—and they don't require an 
            electric mixer. Just mix up the dough, bake, and you'll 
            be enjoying a delicious Christmas-y treat in no time!</p>
